### What is this?

This repository holds the source code for the **Cubos** blog, which you [can read here](https://cubosengine.org). It is built using
[Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), styled with our [fork](https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos-m.css) of [m.css](https://mcss.mosra.cz/)
and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Check out our main repository
[here](https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos).

#### m.css fork

We [forked m.css](https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos-m.css) so that we could easily modify the page templates and the theme colors to match our brand guidelines. We also extended it further with features such as image comparison sliders, which are useful in our release posts.

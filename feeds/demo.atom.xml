</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From 26th of April to 3rd of May, &amp;#64;RiscadoA and &amp;#64;joaomanita participated in the Coffee N' Jam, a game jam organized by GameDev TÃ©cnico, with our engine, &lt;strong&gt;Cubos&lt;/strong&gt;.
The goal was to create a game in a week, with the theme &amp;quot;Apocalypse&amp;quot; - and we had a blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game jam was a great opportunity to test the engine in a real game development scenario, and we learned a lot from it.
The game is called &lt;em&gt;Scraps vs Zombies&lt;/em&gt;, and you can download it from its &lt;a href="https://riscadoa.itch.io/scraps-vs-zombies"&gt;itch.io page&lt;/a&gt;.
You can also check out its source code in our &lt;a href="https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos-demo"&gt;demo repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to win the &amp;quot;Best Gameplay&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;People's Choice&amp;quot; awards, which we're very proud of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a lot of bugs and missing features during the jam. Additionally, we had performance become a problem for the first time.
One particular area that is in dire need of development is Audio, which we've been ignoring so far - people expect to hear something when they play a game!
We'll be working on fixing these issues in the next release, and we'll also be profiling the engine to find out where the bottlenecks are.&lt;/p&gt;

Coffee N' Jam 2024
==================

From 26th of April to 3rd of May, @RiscadoA and @joaomanita participated in the Coffee N' Jam, a game jam organized by GameDev TÃ©cnico, with our engine, **Cubos**.
The goal was to create a game in a week, with the theme "Apocalypse" - and we had a blast!

The game jam was a great opportunity to test the engine in a real game development scenario, and we learned a lot from it.
The game is called *Scraps vs Zombies*, and you can download it from its `itch.io page <https://riscadoa.itch.io/scraps-vs-zombies>`_.
You can also check out its source code in our `demo repository <https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos-demo>`_.

We managed to win the "Best Gameplay" and "People's Choice" awards, which we're very proud of!

We found a lot of bugs and missing features during the jam. Additionally, we had performance become a problem for the first time.
One particular area that is in dire need of development is Audio, which we've been ignoring so far - people expect to hear something when they play a game!
We'll be working on fixing these issues in the next release, and we'll also be profiling the engine to find out where the bottlenecks are.
